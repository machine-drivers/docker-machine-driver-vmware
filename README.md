# Docker Machine VMware Driver

Create Docker machines locally on VMware [Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion)
and [Workstation](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation).

This driver requires VMware Workstation 14 (Windows/Linux) or VMware Fusion 10 (MacOS)
to be installed on your host. Earlier versions of Workstation/Fusion might still work
with this driver, but it's not officially supported.

>
> Docker machine has a builtin driver called `vmwarefusion`. The main difference between
> those drivers is that `vmware` also works on VMware Workstation, while `vmwarefusion` only
> works on VMware Fusion.
